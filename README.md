First off, appologies for the ugly coding - it works, but please feel free to add/edit to make it more elegant and functional.

The repository contains three main codes: The Arduino code for the RFID reader and LED, the Python code to save and interpret lap data, and the HTML code, for uploading data to a local web server.
Throughout the code, it has assumed the Arduino is using COM6 and operating at baud rate 9600.

Arduino Code:
The wiring used for the Arduino is as follows:
RFID:   SS=10, RST = 9, SCK = 13, MISO = 12, MOSI = 11. This is standard wiring as used in many of the MFRC522 Library.
Note - you must download the correct library into the Arduino IDE for the code to run.
The LED is a simple circuit: Pin 4 > LED > 220ohm res > grd

Python Code:
The python code saves raw data to csv, as well as processed lap data. The serial monitor in the Arduino IDE must be closed in order for the Python code to access the data over the COM port. For COM port errors, unplug then replug the arduino.
The graph generated by the python code should save in the same folder as the html code in order for the web server to access the graph. The name for the graph file should match across both python and html codes.
Every time new data is compliled and a new graph generated, the old file is overwritten.
Before running code, it is useful to ensure old csv files are removed from the folder as otherwise new data will be appended on the old files.

HTML Code:
The code is set to refresh every 5 sec, uploading the current graph.
The website can be shared over a local web server by running the following commands in the command line of the host PC:
ipconfig - returns ip adress of host device
-m python http.server
The webserver can then be accessed from other devices connected to the same wifi by typing the adress: "host ip":8000 into a search engine
The website can be accessed over the host PC without wifi by either directly opening the html code as a website, or putting the adress: localhost:8000
